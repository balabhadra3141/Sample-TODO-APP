# Feature-Rich TO-DO Application

A modern, fully responsive TO-DO list application built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3. The application is designed for enhanced usability and detailed task management across all device types.


## âœ¨ Core Features

- **State Persistence**: Tasks are automatically saved to `localStorage`, preserving data between sessions, including the selected Dark/Light Mode preference.

- **Detailed Task Management**: Tasks support a primary title, an optional description field, and are labeled with an "Edited" tag upon modification.

- **Filtering and Status**: Users can filter tasks by All, Pending, or Completed status. Tasks display both Added Time and Completed Time.

- **Accessibility**: Includes task numbering for easy reference and an expandable description area using a toggle arrow.
